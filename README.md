## TinySolrLib
**Apache Solr learning site.
This code implements a bibliographic discovery platform.**

This repository assumes that you have installed Apache Solr. 
I suggest that you install Solr as an initial development environment.

[Solr binary](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/solr/solr/9.2.1/solr-9.2.1.tgz?load"Solr binary")

[Solr installation guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/installing-solr.html "Installing Solr")

This platform is based on a website implemented as a CGI, written in python3. There is also a Golang implementation. 

There is a presentation on how to deploy solr at 

http://solrtinylib.info/reveal.js/solrtinylib_learn.html 

The python demonstration server is at:
https://solrtinylib.info/cgi-bin/search   

The golang demonstration server is at:

Suggestion for an initial search: try * to see all records.
