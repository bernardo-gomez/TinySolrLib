## TinySolrLib
**Apache Solr learning site.
This code implements a bibliographic discovery platform.**

This repository assumes that you have installed Apache Solr. 
I suggest that you install Solr as an initial development environment.

[Solr binary](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/lucene/solr/8.7.0/solr-8.7.0.tgz "Solr binary")

[Solr installation guide](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_7/installing-solr.html "Solr installation guide")

This platform is based on a website implemented as a CGI, written in python3. There is also a Golang implementation. 

There is a presentation on how to deploy solr at 

http://solrtinylib.ga/reveal.js/solrtinylib_learn.html (ask bgomez at emory dot edu to turn the server on at the date and time of your convenience)

The python demonstration server is at:

The golang demonstration server is at:
